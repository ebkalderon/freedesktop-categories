# freedesktop-categories

Static hash map of all application categories as defined by the Freedesktop.org
[Desktop Menu Specification][dm].

[dm]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-latest.html

These categories are used in the parsing of `.desktop` entries on many open
source desktop environments, among other things. They are also present in other
package metadata standards like [AppStream][as].
